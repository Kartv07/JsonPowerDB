# Student Enrollment Form
The HTML form was connected directly to the JsonPower Database. By using the roll number as the primary key, anyone can input, change, or reset the student data here. The use of JPDB makes CRUD operations simple and easy to carry out because it is schema-free. 
JPDB makes everything much faster, smoother, and easier to understand. HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ajax, and JsonPowerDB make up the technology stack.
